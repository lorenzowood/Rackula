<p><b>This is my personal fork of Rackula, which addresses some things that were an issue for me:
<ul>
  <li>There was a maximum of 10 racks per layout; I increased mine to 20.</li>
  <li>There was once a bug which corrupted some layouts with half-width devices; I fixed it, which is in the main repo, and also added an automatic fix-up of corrupted files on load, which the maintainers didn’t like.</li>
  <li>The persistence API was written in Node.js on Bun; I moved my set-up to a VM running on an i7-3770, which lacks the AVX2 instructions required by Bun, so I re-wrote the API in Python.</li>
</ul>
  If you aren't interested in these changes, you’re better off sticking to the original repo at https://github.com/RackulaLives/Rackula.

## What _Is_ This

Plan your rack layout. Drag your devices in, move them around, export it. It runs in your browser. You can close the tab whenever you want.

## What It _Do_

- **Drag and drop devices** into your rack so you can frown at them
- **Real device images** so it actually looks like your gear, not sad grey boxes
- **Export to PNG, PDF, SVG** for your documentation or for printing and staring at
- **QR code sharing** - your layout lives in a URL, scan it and it just shows up

## But _Why?_

You might ask, why should I make an imaginary rack like some sort of IT cosplay? And to that I would say, "fine then! don't! SCRAM!" but also, consider:

- **Plan your layouts** before you build them. It's a lot easier to move your mouse than that 4U server full of hard drives. Your shoulder will thank you.
- **Document existing layouts** so you know what is where.
- **Because you can**

## Get Started

### **Use it right now:** [count.racku.la](https://count.racku.la)

### Selfhost with Docker

#### Docker Run

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/rackulalives/rackula:latest
```

#### Docker Compose

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rackulalives/rackula/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` and get after it.

### Persistent Storage (Self-Hosted)

For layouts that persist across sessions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RackulaLives/Rackula.git
cd Rackula
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RackulaLives/Rackula/main/deploy/docker-compose.persist.yml -o docker-compose.yml
mkdir -p data
sudo chown 1001:1001 data
docker compose up -d
```

See [Self-Hosting Guide](docs/guides/SELF-HOSTING.md) for details.

For production/self-hosted API security:

- `CORS_ORIGIN` should be your real app URL (restricts which browser origins can call the API).
- `RACKULA_API_WRITE_TOKEN` protects API `PUT`/`DELETE` routes (optional, strongly recommended). If unset, write routes remain open.
- `RACKULA_AUTH_MODE` controls centralized auth gate behavior:
  - `none`: auth gate disabled (best for local/trusted development only)
  - `oidc`: use an OpenID Connect provider (requires provider config plus `RACKULA_AUTH_SESSION_SECRET`)
  - `local`: local auth mode (requires `RACKULA_AUTH_SESSION_SECRET`; tracking: [#1117](https://github.com/RackulaLives/Rackula/issues/1117))
- `RACKULA_AUTH_SESSION_SECRET` is required when auth mode is enabled (minimum 32 characters). Use a random secret and rotate it when needed.
- Current stable auth hardening: deny-by-default gate, signed session cookies, timeout/rotation policy, CSRF enforcement.
- Current auth flow maturity: OIDC/local login provider wiring is still in progress.
- For HTTPS deployments, set `RACKULA_AUTH_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true` (compose templates default to this). Only set `false` for local HTTP testing.
- Session hardening defaults are enabled when auth is on:
  - `HttpOnly` cookie, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` in production
  - bounded absolute + idle session lifetime
  - CSRF checks on state-changing cookie-authenticated requests

Generate strong secrets:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Set values in a `.env` file beside `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
cat > .env <<'EOF'
CORS_ORIGIN=https://rack.example.com
RACKULA_API_WRITE_TOKEN=replace-with-generated-token
RACKULA_AUTH_MODE=none
# To enable auth gate:
# RACKULA_AUTH_MODE=oidc
# RACKULA_AUTH_MODE=local
# RACKULA_AUTH_SESSION_SECRET=replace-with-generated-secret
# RACKULA_AUTH_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true
EOF
docker compose up -d
```

Or pass them inline:

```bash
CORS_ORIGIN=https://rack.example.com \
RACKULA_API_WRITE_TOKEN=replace-with-generated-token \
docker compose up -d
```

### Python API (AVX2-incompatible hardware)

The default API sidecar uses Bun, which requires AVX2 CPU instructions. If you're running on older hardware (e.g. Intel Ivy Bridge / Sandy Bridge era) that lacks AVX2, a drop-in Python replacement is available in [`api-python/`](api-python/).

It implements the same routes, filesystem layout, and environment variables as the original — no data migration needed.

**Build and deploy:**

```bash
cd api-python
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t rackula-api-python:latest .
```

In your `docker-compose.yml`, swap the API image:

```yaml
rackula-api:
  image: rackula-api-python:latest # instead of ghcr.io/rackulalives/rackula-api:latest
```

Then restart the API container:

```bash
docker compose up -d --no-deps rackula-api
```

All other environment variables (`DATA_DIR`, `CORS_ORIGIN`, `RACKULA_API_WRITE_TOKEN`) work identically.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RackulaLives/Rackula.git
cd Rackula && npm install && npm run build
```

Serve the `dist/` folder however you like. It's just files.

## Built With Claude

This project was built using AI-assisted development with Claude. I told it what to build and then said "no, not like that" a lot. The AI did a lot of typing. Commits with substantial AI contributions are marked with `Co-authored-by` tags because we're not going to pretend otherwise.
